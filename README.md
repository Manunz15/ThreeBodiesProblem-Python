# ThreeBodiesProblem-Python
A simulation of the three bodies problem with the Verlet integration method.

The masses are in Exagrams, the distances in milions of km and the velocity is in km/s.

In Settings.py there are some constants like the masses of Earth, Moon, Mars...
In Objects.py there is the definition of the class Object, with properties as mass, x, y, vx..., and all the equation of the Verlet integration method. In this version the motion will be in 2D, but it can easily be upgraded to a 3D motion.
The main code is the ThreeBodiesProblem.py file, you can switch preset changing the number at the line 11.

Enjoy
